FUNCTIONS:
clear():
	clears the shell/terminal screen

create_grid(xl, yl, initchar):
	generates a fresh xl by yl grid of whatever character initchar is. initchar will default to a space if not given.

create_grid_from_file(filename, ignore_newlines = True):
	generates a grid by using the characters of the file as the values for each index in the grid.

print_grid(grid):
	clears the shell screen (on default), then prints grid onto the shell

setchar(x, y, grid, new_char):
	changes the individual character at (x, y) in grid to new_char

getchar(x, y, grid):
	returns the character stored at location x, y in grid

get_grid_chunk(old_grid, x, y, xl, yl)
	returns a new smaller grid that is a part of a larger grid. 
	the new grid starts at x, y in old_grid and is xl long and yl high, going right and down. 

draw_line(grid, x, y, direction, length, new_char)
	draws a line, starting at point (x, y) that is length characters long of new_char
