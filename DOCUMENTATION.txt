setchar(x, y, grid, new_char):
	changes the individual character at (x, y) in grid to new_char

getchar(x, y, grid):
	returns the character stored at location x, y in grid

get_grid_chunk(old_grid, x, y, xl, yl)
	returns a new smaller grid that is a part of a larger grid. 
	the new grid starts at x, y in old_grid and is xl long and yl high, going right and down. 

draw_line(grid, x, y, direction, length, new_char)
	draws a line, starting at point (x, y) that is length characters long of new_char
